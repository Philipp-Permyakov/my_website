<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<p>For May and Jun 2020 we see that the curves are more flat compared to the previous years. This can be explained by Covid. Also it shows that bike rentals in May and June 2020 are distributed evenly between 20k and 60k, while in the previous years you always have a peak that shows that in the previous years we had for each month a certain number for daily rentals that didnâ€™t differ that much by day.</p>

<p>In our calculation of expected rentals we use mean, as according to the distribution of bikes hired
per month there are no clear outliers. Mean allows to capture the whole sample, accounting for absolute values in high-peaked seasons.
It results in a more representing calculation of expected number of bikes hired in each period.</p>
